## INTRODUCTION
   
  This project was developed in the context of "Advance Coding Tools and Methodologies" course held at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/). It was asked to develop a website that relates to the Master degree of [Music and Acoustic Engineering](https://suono.polimi.it/), in which the course is inserted.
  This project has the aim of create a space environment where the user can be admire images of the universe and interact with them. Sounds are generated by an algorhythm of image-processing and they can be modified by the user to adapt music to its taste.
