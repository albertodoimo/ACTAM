## INTRODUCTION
   
  This project was developed in the context of "Advance Coding Tools and Methodologies" course held at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/). It was asked to develop a website that relates to the Master degree of [Music and Acoustic Engineering](https://suono.polimi.it/), in which the course is inserted.
  This project has the aim of create a space environment where the user can be admire images of the universe and interact with them. Sounds are generated by an algorhythm of image-processing and they can be modified by the user to adapt music to its taste.

## User Guide

The system can be tested by the user in two ways: 

- <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hosted Website</a>
- Downloading the whole project from GitHub and running it using VS CODE live server
  

### First page
![]()
In this page the user is asked to choose an image from the proposed selection. 
Now the algorhythm analyzes the image to extract:
- The color palette 
- ...

### Second page

This page shows in detail the extracted parameters along with the image itself. Here the user can visualize how the algorhythm connects image and sound.
