# **THE SOUND OF SPACE**

This project was developed in the context of the "Advanceed Coding Tools and Methodologies" course held at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) for the Master's Degree in [Music and Acoustic Engineering](https://suono.polimi.it/). The task was to design and implement a musical web application.
This project has the aim of create a space environment where the user can be admire images of the universe and interact with them. Sounds are generated by an algorhythm of image-processing and they can be modified by the user to adapt music to its taste.
